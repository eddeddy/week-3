Write a program that sets a password as ‘changeme’ and asks the user to enter the password and keeps asking until the 
correct password is entered and then says ‘Accepted’. The program should count how many attempts the user has taken
and tell them after they have been accepted. Extra Challenge: If the user takes more than 5 attempts the program 
should say, ‘Access denied, please press enter to exit and contact security to reset your password’

y = 'changeme' 
i = 0 
while i <= 5:
  x = input("Enter the password") 
  if x == y:
    print("Accepted")
    break 
  else: 
    print("Try again") 
    i += 1 
  if i == 5: 
    print("Access denied") 
    break
