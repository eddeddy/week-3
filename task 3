Find the errors in the following if statements. Make corrections. 
a)if x > 0 then : -> without then print(x)
b)if (1 + x) > ( x ** sqrt(2) ):
y = y + x
c)if x = 1 :
y += 1 -> it  must be two ==
d) letterGrade = "F" -> it need space and input and print
if grade >= 90 : 
letterGrade = "A" 
if grade >= 80 : 
letterGrade = "B" 
if grade >= 70 : 
letterGrade = "C" 
if grade >= 60 : 
letterGrade = "D"
